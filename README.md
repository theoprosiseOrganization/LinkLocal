# Overview

**People Connection** is a web application designed to facilitate connections and activities among friends when they are geographically close. It uses geolocation and mapping technology to notify users when friends are nearby, enabling them to plan activities and meetups. The app addresses the challenge of coordinating spontaneous meetups and activities among friends who are in close proximity but may not be aware of each other's presence, as well as allows users in new areas to have the knowledge of an experienced local.

- **Category:** Social Networking  
- **Story:** Users sign up and create profiles. The app notifies them when friends are nearby, allowing them to view and join activities. Users can also create and share their own activities, connect with local guides, and participate in community discussions.  
- **Market:** Social individuals who enjoy spontaneous meetups and activities, likely targeting young adults who are tech-savvy and socially active.  
- **Habit:** The app is designed for frequent use, potentially daily, as users check for nearby friends and activities, plan meetups, and engage with community content.  
- **Scope:** Initially, the app focuses on geolocation-based social networking, including media posting and sharing by users. It may expand to include more advanced features like AI-driven recommendations and business partnerships.
